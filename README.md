Chong 4.x
=========
The Chong family of FRC code continues its legacy in 2016. Wucas is our savior, and Wick Woss is our god. Riding their majestic mammoths, they pass through the crowd of programming hopefuls everywhere, providing them love and inspiration. Our enemy is the Shrek Nation, and the integuments of the horror they bring, confusing us with poorly-written LabView code riddled with while loops. Fortunately, nothing can stand up to the might of the deities Wucas and Wick Woss and the Maybach Music World.  

We, Soldiers of the Seals, armed with our keyboards and equiped with a multitude of reddit karma, are still not fully prepared for competition. Follow the URL to get the software needed!
